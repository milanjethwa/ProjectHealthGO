# ProjectHealthGO
HealthGO is Non Invasive way to diagnosis diabetes. There are ways to determine glucose using non invasive method and Invasive method but  as we know in Invasive method finger pricking hurts too much to elder people and small kids for diabetes diagnosis and non invasive method are also there but  none of them are accurate and cost 10 times more than our device. HealthGo is Device which allows to determine glucose by just blowing through device. As This data is Represented on Android Mobile again HealthGO device interacts with android device for sharing data using Bluetooth and Android sends data to Server for Determining the Glucose level using Machine Learning Model. This is only device which is developed in Rajasthan hackathon and No Such Device available through out the World. There is no such device which make ease to diagnosis the glucose level and we have developed that device. Here We have Machine Learning Model with Regression Coefficient of 0.9962. Which Gives +-10 mg/dl predictions as compare to Invasive Method. As more Data we get more Accuracy we can make.
